esmBot is an easily-extendable, multipurpose, and entertainment-focused Discord bot made using [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris/) with image, music, and utility commands, alongside many others.

## Usage
You can invite the bot to your server using this link: https://projectlounge.pw/invite

A command list can be found [here](https://projectlounge.pw/esmBot/help.html).

If you want to self-host the bot, a guide can be found [here](https://github.com/esmBot/esmBot/wiki/Setup).

Just wanted to mess with self hosting the bot on a small friend group server
